# Portfolio Refined Minimal Design - Final Summary

## 🎨 Final Design Adjustments
Implemented specific refinements to achieve a strict minimal, editorial aesthetic.

### Core Visual Changes
1.  **Link Styling**:
    *   **Always Underlined**: Links are clearly distinguishable.
    *   **Yellow Highlight Hover**: A subtle `#fef08a` background highlights links on hover, mimicking a highlighter marker.
2.  **"Now" Section**:
    *   Made prominent with a subtle warm background (`#fdfbf7`) and a left accent border.
3.  **Section Markers**:
    *   Removed `//` characters for cleaner headers (e.g., "Now", "Previously", "Selected Work").
4.  **Connect Section**:
    *   Integrated directly into the Homepage and Footer.
    *   Removed the separate `/connect` page.

### Page-Specific Refinements

#### 🏠 Homepage
*   **Photo**: Updated to a circular grayscale avatar.
*   **Layout**: Flow includes Identity → About → Navigation → Now → Previous → Work → Connect.

#### 📚 Teaching
*   **Simplified**: Removed small course codes (LDE, etc.).
*   **Lists**: Unified MBA and MDP sections into consistent, tight lists.
*   **Spacing**: Reduced vertical margins for a denser, information-rich feel.

#### 📝 Publications
*   **No Accordion**: Replaced interactive elements with simple, scannable lists.
*   **Typography**: Clean, unstyled lists focusing on content readability.

#### 👤 About
*   **No Tabs**: Converted to a single scrollable page with "Biography", "Education", and "Recognition" sections.
